Iâ€™m originally from western North Carolina where I studied Homeland Security and Emergency Management at a small HBCU (Historically Black College or University) on the coast called Elizabeth City State University. I then went to Marine Corps Officer Candidate School and commissioned as an officer in the Marine Corps (USMC). I learned leadership, discipline, and teamwork in the USMC and will be a Marine all my life. After the USMC, I moved to West Virginia to spend my time volunteering with a local nonprofit and church doing work with those plagued by addiction and housing vulnerability. I also do a lot of construction work on the homes of those with no ability or knowledge to fix it themselves. I enjoy practically helping people with life's problems and seeing them embrace the human experience in a way that releases the bonds of addiction and trauma. 

My journey into the world of technology began through a deep-seated love for problem-solving and an unwavering commitment to hard work. I thrive on the thrill of unraveling complex puzzles, whether it's debugging a tricky piece of code or architecting a new software solution. My dream would be to work for a company where that bigger picture of life is tied with the satisfaction of seeing my coding efforts materialize into fully-fledged projects. I want each line of code to ultimately help bridge gaps in this world and connect individuals on a journey to healing and recovery. My aspiration as a software engineer is to continue pushing boundaries, bringing innovation to life, and making a meaningful impact on the world through the fusion of technology and a passion for people.

Some of my hobbies are hiking, backpacking, working with electricity, dabbling in construction, playing with dogs, swimming, working out, playing guitar, reading, kayaking, and basically anything outside!
